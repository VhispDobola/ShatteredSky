Overview:
Shattered Sky is a level-based action platformer with horizontal scrolling. Players leap between collapsing terrain, battle corrupted guardians, and master momentum-driven dashes and glides. Levels feature branching paths, allowing players to replay towers for secrets, lore, and upgrades. Bosses guard fragments of the Sky Core, each tied to unique elemental powers.

Backstory
The world of Shattered Sky exists among floating continents, suspended by the mystical Sky Core. Once thriving and interconnected, the islands now collapse into the void, leaving survivors scrambling to endure. Mutated beasts stalk the skies, and ancient towers hide the last remnants of stability.

Generations ago, a war shattered the Sky Core, scattering its fragments across the world. The protagonist—one of the last survivors of a fallen village—seeks to restore the Core before all is lost. Their journey through perilous towers is not only for survival but for redemption, carrying the weight of their destroyed home.

Characters

* Protagonist: A young sky-climber with a grappling hook and a tattered cape that doubles as a glider. Agile, determined, and driven by the loss of their homeland, they fight to reforge the Sky Core and prevent further collapse.
* Antagonists: Mutated sky beasts, rival scavengers lusting after Core fragments, and corrupted tower guardians.
* Key Characters: A mysterious guide leaving cryptic notes, and elemental tower bosses who embody fractured pieces of the Sky Core.

Target Market
Target audience: ages 12–30.
Players who enjoy atmospheric pixel-art platformers with a balance of challenge and story. Fans of Celeste, Hollow Knight, and Ori and the Blind Forest will appreciate the precision mechanics, worldbuilding, and emotional depth.

Player Motivations

* Unlocking new traversal abilities (extended glides, grapple upgrades).
* Collecting hidden lore fragments.
* Defeating bosses to reclaim Sky Core shards.
* Exploring branching towers for secrets and alternate endings.

Unique Selling Point
The collapse mechanic makes levels dynamic—platforms crumble and storms push players forward, forcing quick yet strategic movement. Combined with atmospheric pixel art, branching progression, and lore-driven exploration, this mechanic creates urgency and replayability.

Inspirations & Competition
Inspirations:

* Celeste → precision platforming and emotional storytelling.
* Hollow Knight → atmospheric exploration and boss design.
* Ori and the Blind Forest → fluid traversal and environmental storytelling.

Competition: Competes with Celeste. Unlike Celeste, Shattered Sky integrates collapsing environments, dynamic hazards, and branching tower paths for tension and replayability.

Goals
Players should feel urgency, wonder, and triumph. Collapsing levels create tension, exploration sparks curiosity, and precise traversal rewards mastery. Emotional story beats tied to the world’s downfall deepen the sense of purpose and achievement.
