# ShatteredSky
Level-based action platformer with horizontal scrolling. Players leap between collapsing terrain, battle corrupted guardians, and master momentum-driven dashes and glides. Levels feature branching paths, allowing players to replay towers for secrets, lore, and upgrades. Bosses guard fragments of the Sky Core, each tied to unique elemental powers.
